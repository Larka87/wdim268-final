Instructions:

Every person will have the same six photoshop layer comps. You will turn these comps into valid HTML5/CSS3. Notations within the comps will guide you (only used on first layer comp). Use "Layer Comps" feature to see each page.

Tips
The headers, footers and sidebars are the exact same on most of the pages. Even the content pages are pretty similar.
Define markup and styles that are easily repeatable.
Sometimes an image is just an image.
SEMANTICS: I'm giving you the picture, you turn it into standards-driven, semantic, clean code. SEMANTICS COUNT A LOT.

We will have LOTS of time to work on this in class for the rest of the term. Each class period for the rest of the term, we'll go over specific techniques to solve design challenges on this project.
Full width repeating backgrounds.
Hover menus.
Image replacement.
Various effects: button textures, flares, font-face

About the file: This Photoshop CS5 psd file uses "layer comps" to allow multiple layouts in a single file. Layer comps just let you hide/show different layers to represent each page. Also used heavily are PSD comments.

The Presentation

Show off your awesome work and what you learned. Talk about your techniques, your markup, your CSS, the technologies involved.

Being a modern designer/developer is more than just knowing code. You must be able to talk about your work.

The presentation is worth as much as the code. Prepare ahead of time.
